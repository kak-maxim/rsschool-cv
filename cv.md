## About myself
I have been interested in programming for this year.  
іI started with the C language (C++), then I realized that I liked web development more and chose HTML/CSS and RubyRails,  
 but for Ruby it was difficult for me to find information and lessons that could explain everything in detail.  
 That's why I started looking for analogues and JavaScript became it. While going to Java, I tried different programming languages, so I can easily enter them.   
 Now I study at the university and there we pass C++, so I know the minimum in my opinion.  I really like the process of writing the code and its result.
